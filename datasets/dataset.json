        "text": "The elephants and wagons stood ready; the nobility and the high-ranking officials stood up after making their obeisance to return to their units of elephants and horses. The outstanding prime minister Sumantryadi gave the order to everyone to line up at the main highway. The leaders of the villagers came forward to pay their humble obeisance to the king, together with offerings of cooked and uncooked food, e.g., fruits, water buffaloes, fish, meat of deer, etc., to prepare empal-empalan, a kind of meat dish, boiled or fried, with all kinds of spices. The spokesmen told them to line up and carry the things they wanted to offer, cakes and dishes of all kinds of bee larvae; nobody came empty-handed. After they had handed over their offerings, they sat at the side of the road to see the king pass by. At that moment, the prime minister ordered them to sit five by five along the road, so that the road was clear, like the mind of the people, free from disappointment; the gustis, wariyas, were not offended, and the brahmins were also given respect accordingly. Along the way home, the road was decorated with banners and hangings. The king and the queen, under one umbrella, walked together, talking and laughing, discharging all feelings of longing. The multitude was tumultuous; they jostled one another, they were affected by the sight of the king and queen loving each other. Some were offering garlands which could not be forwarded as they were pushed from behind. They turned angrily to those pushing them, asked to stop, but in vain. Others were looking at one another, very much in love, and were turned on when they were pinched and poked, their breasts molested. Bharata was behind, slightly embarrassed to see his beloved brother with his wife walking in front, laughing and talking to make everyone happy. But his brother, seeing him in the rear, called him and took his hands, as he felt his longing for him had not been abated. And the presents were so many; dresses and ornaments were distributed to the monkeys."

        "text": "Many monkeys were fighting for sugarcane, which they swung slightly before breaking it on their knees. They walked buoyantly, drank coconut milk to their fill along the road. They scraped out the flesh and ate it, while some of its juice fell on their breasts, making it wet. Then the fruit of the tal tree were served, after being duly prepared. Thus were the presents of the royal couple to them. The monkeys were a bit embarrassed because they were by nature agile and playful. That was what they did along the way. When they arrived at the periphery of the capital city, the king ordered that the monkeys be given presents in order to gain the sympathy of the people who came to meet and to see them. Groups of onlookers were stretching up to see the monkeys, the inhabitants of the woods, and the beautiful decorations dangling on the music horns, which sounded so merry. They talked to one another, discussing the one who was designed to rule the world, following his success in his work elsewhere, and that was now coming. Bharata approached to relieve Lak manQ.d;ia; in turn, Lak manQ.d;ia relieved Mainda in carrying the attributes. Satrughna became his counterpart when he took the place of Nala, carrying the golden umbrella above the head of the king. The four of them looked perfect, looking like beautiful trees, giving shelter to the world by means of the four ways: sama, settlement; dana, compensation; daQ.nQ.d;ia, force; and bhĕda, sowing dissension. When they were already well arranged in the palace, the priests and the religious teachers came happily to welcome them with everything for the ceremony of welcome, to create a peaceful atmosphere. The dancers were staging a performance; others were singing the tunes, while another group was playing the gamelan, which sounded sweet and captivating. The dancers performed a war dance; both stood and walked around, rising and swooping, moving swiftly with full force, attacking one another, whilst the kansi was followed by lively baQ.nQ.gun and flutes."

The great audience hall was marvelously decorated with gold, silver, jewels, and hangings of pearls. The eaves were hung with clothes, red-and-white-colored, red from sindura and white from the sap of duray, which is yellowish-white of color. There were also black camara fans, which looked like the mustache of the audience hall, and other decorations were paper lanterns, tanluh, kya-kya fruit, and yellow coconuts, varying one another in color and luster. Everybody was amazed at the sight of all the decorations, even more so when they saw the king sitting on his throne, studded with great stones shining brilliantly.\n\nThe king and queen arrived and sat on the thrones. The guests, the famous king of Lenka and the king of the monkeys, were also sitting on jeweled thrones, followed by the son of Kĕkayi, Somitra, and Satrughna. They took garlands and wore them, and took a bit of all food and drinks that were served, e.g., meat and fish from the wood and ocean. Oh, it was too much to be described what had gone on in the golden hall.\n\nThe monkeys at the north royal square were also served, under the supervision of Jambawan and Susena. They were urged again and again by the king to eat everything in the food boxes together with drinks of all kinds, until the monkeys became drunk, and their faces were red, and still the drinks were not yet finished.\n\nThe ears of the king of the monkeys were red-colored, as the four of them were affected by liquor. The monkeys, overwhelmed by the power of liquor, stood up and made their obeisance with a toast, which was accepted and followed by others. Then they sang about the defeat of RawanQ.a with a good voice, accompanied by flutes and other instruments, which gave enjoyment and merriment to the monkeys, as they were fond of music."

Then the betel box was served with all the ingredients and instruments, alternated with drinks and other food, variously prepared with different flavors which made the body warm and sweating caused by the liquor. Then those serving the body-cream, made of curcuma and cool sandalwood mixture came forward and applied it to the breast, shoulders, and neck, and the refreshing effect penetrated into the heart. The camara-fans gave a soft and sweet breeze which made their hearts happy. When they wanted to wear flowers, there was a collection of lotuses, campakas, bolus, gadluns, pandanus, and the aromatic utkatas. Then they went out to the royal square, followed by the younger brothers and the virtuous guests. Prince Bharata came to the guests and stood amongst the monkeys, who were eating and drinking. There was a crippled attendant of the court called Bhaṇḍira who came to prince Bharata and joined him to welcome the guests with information and requests to the guests:\n\n'What is lacking? What should be requested in greater quantities? Is there not enough of anything? Betel, crackers, crisps, or rinsing water? There is rice-gruel in the golden bowls. There are meatballs with salty or sour sauce. Do not be bashful! Do not act as a guest, feel at home! Come forward and help yourself. If you want a dish of blood, please wait for a while, and while your time away drinking liquor. Fill up your glasses, do not worry about getting drunk. There are eggs, please help yourself with lobsters. What is the taste like? It is filled up at one side with something that is taken care of by the handy cook who prepares the tasty things which has given him a reputation of a clever cook. If it were not so, he could not be accepted here, and would be dismissed. That is why he is afraid of doing something wrong. Now, the dishes of lobsters should be described. Before it is cooked, it is cut into pieces and quickly put onto skewers and the white flesh is then roasted, and it will not be served before it is turned over and over. The liver of the shark and the hawula-fish is cooked, wrapped in banana leaves. For those who want great strength, the meat of the following animals is recommended, e.g., rabbits, wild hen, all of them taste good. Not to mention the good meat described in the cookbook which includes black sheep, lizards of all kinds, wild pigeons, rice-birds, and also quails.\n\nWait for the dishes prepared from the meat of porcupines which is in the same group with ant-eaters. Hey boys, bring forward everything quickly, leave for a while that which is not yet prepared. Bring forward and serve them to the monkey heroes. Satisfy their appetite. And you, my dear guests, when you have almost finished your plate, you may come to the kitchen, and take another plate, as big as a winnow, and fill it up with pork and crisps, steamed arrowroot. Behold how a warawan-dish is prepared. Take the sting out of a big wood-scorpion, because it is well-known to the world, that the scorpion has a superb taste. The taste of the meat of a flying fox is strongly aromatic, fatty, stiff, and tough and sticky. You must chew it well first, then swallow, because if you are not lucky, your throat may be affected. The tulirin and shellfish should be prepared carefully, as the cook will be ashamed if they do not taste well. Take a taste also of the dishes of turtle-meat, all kinds of lawar (dishes prepared of blood), all kinds of meat-soups, meat prepared in bamboo, all kinds of penets, all kinds of sour dishes, all kinds of dishes in coconut-leaves boxes, all kinds of sarads, steamed vegetables, all kinds of dishes prepared in hot ashes; the mince-meat mixed with vegetables, pure vegetable salads. Put a drop of lemon juice when eating them. Ask for rice at will. If you want to drink water, suit yourself, but there are also honey, strong roe of fish, aromatic coconut cream, and palm wine. There are also sweetmeats, jackfruit, salak, not to mention butter cakes, crisps, and unequalled sesame perfume. Please have some!\n\nThere are various kinds of fine snacks consisting of roasted nuts and beans. If you want to eat them, peel them off first, but take it by the handful as quickly as possible. If you drink cold water, do not wet yourself. Then you can eat tuber, jackfruit, yellow bananas, excellent sweet salaks, and drink it with sugarcane juice. The youths should drink beneficial milkshakes, do not suck the sweet and delicious jukut, and do not miss the delicious lepet wrapped in banana leaves, and looks whitish. What will follow is the ultimate of delicacies. It is cooked in coconut cream and looks tough but smooth (sweet cake). That sticky one is made of glutinous rice with a little curcuma. Now, look at that one rising up between the others. They are so eager to imitate the drummer and brandishing a club, like people fighting with clubs, gleaming brilliantly like a man cooking oil in a vessel, and the firewood is sizzling and clattering like shots from guns, very frightening. By fours they go into the oil intoxicated but bravely fighting. The bubur susu suddha (milk-porridge of perfection, a kind of dessert) is not yet cooked, as it is eaten only after the minds are sobering after intoxication, affected by the fighting with drink-bottles (caused by liberal drinking). However, the flowers are ready. What is the significance of all these enjoyments? It is the fruit reaped by the victorious hero. He will find fame, great wealth, but most of all he should be thankful always to god Maheśwara, the origin of all happiness and eternal peace in the world."
